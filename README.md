# Python_Tutorial
This is an (Incomplete) python tutorial, using python itself!

# Why i started this and why i didn't finish it:

I started working on this project circa february, the reason is, i wanted to create some python tutorial for beginners that is created using python itself as demonstration of how great and easy to use this language really is, it in the process learned a few new stuff myself, and i was determined to finsih this project no matter how long it takes me, this also was based on a tutorial i wrote a few months prior to starting this project, although, it was a normal written tutorial, was thinking about filming it sometime in the future, and still will do soon.
The reason i didn't finish it is, simply life got in the way, i am a college student, and when midterms came in RIGHT BEFORE finals, i wasn't able to work on it for over a month and a half, then when the summer break came i got dragged into alot of other stuff (some of them are projects i have uploaded on my GitHub account), that plus a few courses, i wasn't able to continue working on it, although i am determined on finishing it, with how life is going right now, it will take me some more time.

Feel free to add stuff on the code, or contact me if you have any questions :D

There is a file that is almost empty and the others are incomplete for the reasons i mentioned above.
